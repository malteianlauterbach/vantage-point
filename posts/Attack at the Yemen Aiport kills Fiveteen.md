Yemen: The Houthi insurgency in Yemen strikes another bloody toll today-with approximately 15 killed and more injured. Here's what we know:

The members of the Yemeni government’s newly formed Cabinet, including Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed, were involved in an explosion after their plane landed Wednesday in the city of Aden, which MOAMMAR AL-ERYANI, Minister of Information, Culture, and Tourism call a "cowardly terrorist attack carried out by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia." 
Mohammed al-Roubid, deputy head of Aden’s health office, told the Associated Press that at least 16 people were killed in the explosion and 60 were wounded. The undersecretary for the Ministry of Human Rights for Yemen has been confirmed dead.
The Yemeni Ministry of Interior accuses the Houthi rebels of being behind the Aden airport explosions.
The cause of the explosions has not been identified yet.
Clear CCTV footage shows that there were two distant explosions separated by 30 seconds
What exists as speculation
a)The explosion(s) were caused by a mortar attack.

Realistic? 5/10
What speaks for it?
There's been a series of mortar attacks in the region in the last month.

What speaks against it?
The angle of fire of the projectile visible is to low for a mortar.
The damage of the second explosion is too high for a conventional mortar.

b) The explosions were caused by a precise guided Badr 1P-missile

Realistic? 7/10
What speaks for it?
The angle of attack is similar to those known by BM missiles
Damage in the second explosion is similar 
What speaks against it?
cause of first explosion unknown then
why was the obvious target not hit?

c)The explosions were caused by a UAV that was shot down in the area

Realistic? 2/10
What speaks for it? A UAV was downed in the area

What speaks against it?
The Huthis which are blamed for the attack are not using UAVs with precise guided rockets. 
International engagement is unrealistic but possible.

Conclusion: We'll have to wait for the Cabinet to show the evidence that supports their blame so we can determine what type of explosive was used, as guided missiles use different explosives.
As always, stay safe, support free press.
