After almost 4 years having Custos Vera based on Plain text html hosted on a server in <redacted>, causing outages on and then,we today decided to take a great lep forward and decided to switch to an implementation of our webpage in next.js, hosted on the serverless platform Vercel, which grants us almsot downtime-less, or atleast less downtime than before. 
Thats all, lets hope the design gets better later on.
