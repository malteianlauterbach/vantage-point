After almost 4 years of having Custos Vera based on Plain text HTML hosted on a server in <redacted>, causing outages on and then, we today decided to take a great leap forward and decided to switch to implementation of our webpage in next.js, hosted on the serverless platform Vercel, which grants us almost downtime-less service or at least less downtime than before. 
That's all, lets hope the design gets better later on.
